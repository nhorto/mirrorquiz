### Video 1: "The Shocked Reaction"

> "I am not okay right now. I just took this quiz called MirrorQuiz and I need to talk about it. So you answer questions about yourself — like how you'd rate your own personality. Then you send it to your friends and they answer the exact same questions about you. And it shows you where you don't match. Like the things you believe about yourself that the people closest to you just don't see. Some of my results were the complete opposite of what I expected. I'm still processing. It's free to take, the link is right there in the ad. But I'm warning you… you might not like what you find out."

**Text Hook:** "my friends see me SO differently"

### Video 2: "The Gossip / Telling a Friend"

> "Ok stop whatever you're doing because I need to tell you about this. It's called MirrorQuiz. You take this personality quiz about yourself, right? Then you send a link to your friends and they answer the same exact questions about you. And then it literally shows you the gap between how you see yourself and how they see you. My best friend answered so differently from me on almost everything. I had to text her immediately like girl what do you mean. It's free to take, just click the link. But send it to a friend you trust because some of these answers are going to surprise you."

**Text Hook:** "why did nobody tell me about this"

### Video 3: "The Dare"

> "Don't take this quiz if you're not ready to hear the truth about yourself. I'm dead serious. It's called MirrorQuiz. You rate yourself on things like confidence, honesty, how emotional you are. Then your friends rate you on the exact same things. And it shows you the difference. Most people think they know exactly how they come across to other people. They don't. Not even close. The quiz is free but honestly I don't know for how long. Link is right there. Take it before you talk yourself out of it."

**Text Hook:** "most people can't handle this quiz"

### Video 4: "The Curiosity Gap"

> "I need to ask you something. Do you actually know how your friends see you? Because there's this quiz called MirrorQuiz and it will show you. You answer questions about your personality, then your friends answer the same ones about you. And it puts them side by side. You think you're easy going? Your friends might disagree. You think you're a good listener? Mm, maybe not according to them. The gaps between what you think and what they think are honestly kind of wild. It's free, the link is right there. But here's the real test — send it to your best friend. If you're not even a little scared to see what they say… you're lying."

**Text Hook:** "your friends won't say this to your face"

### Video 5: "The Identity Crisis"

> "I've been thinking about this all day. I took this quiz called MirrorQuiz and it kind of messed me up. In a good way. So here's how it works. You answer questions about who you think you are. Your friends answer the same questions about you. And then it shows you exactly where you see yourself differently than everyone else does. And for me it was a lot of places. Like things I was so sure about, my friends saw completely differently. It's free, the link is in the ad. Honestly everyone should take this at least once."

**Text Hook:** "this quiz kind of broke me"
