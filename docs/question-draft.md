# PerceptionQuiz — Question Draft (v2)

Based on self-other agreement research (Vazire SOKA model, Big Five meta-analyses, illusory superiority studies). Designed for maximum gap potential between self-perception and friend perception.

## Design Principles

- **Self version:** Behavioral/situational wording (harder to self-enhance)
- **Friend version:** Impression-based wording (easier for friends to rate from overall experience)
- **Scale:** 1-5 with labeled anchors per question (see anchor notes below)
- **Question count:** 15 questions across 5 categories (3 per category)
- **Category selection:** Based on where research shows the largest and most emotionally resonant self-other gaps

---

## Scale Anchors

Each question uses one of two anchor sets depending on the question type:

**Frequency anchors:**
1 = Almost never | 2 = Rarely | 3 = Sometimes | 4 = Often | 5 = Almost always

**Comparison anchors:**
1 = Much less than most people | 2 = Somewhat less | 3 = About the same | 4 = Somewhat more | 5 = Much more than most people

---

## Category 1: Patience & Kindness Under Pressure

*Research basis: Agreeableness has the lowest self-other agreement (r=.46). People dramatically overrate how patient and kind they are when things aren't going well. This is the single richest blind spot territory.*

### Q1
- **Self:** "When someone is annoying me, I stay patient and don't let it show."
- **Friend:** "When [Name] is annoyed or frustrated, they stay patient and don't take it out on others."
- **Anchors:** Frequency
- **Gap direction:** Most people overrate (blind spot territory)

### Q2
- **Self:** "When a friend comes to me with a problem, I listen fully before jumping in with advice or my own experience."
- **Friend:** "[Name] is the kind of person who really listens when you have a problem, instead of jumping in with advice."
- **Anchors:** Frequency
- **Gap direction:** Most people overrate (blind spot territory)

### Q3
- **Self:** "I give people the benefit of the doubt, even when they've let me down."
- **Friend:** "[Name] gives people the benefit of the doubt, even when they've been let down."
- **Anchors:** Frequency
- **Gap direction:** Most people overrate (blind spot territory)

---

## Category 2: Reliability & Follow-Through

*Research basis: Conscientiousness shows significant overestimation bias. People remember their successes and forget dropped commitments. Friends track every unfulfilled "I'll text you back" and "we should hang out soon."*

### Q4
- **Self:** "When I say I'll do something — show up, text back, send that thing — I actually follow through."
- **Friend:** "When [Name] says they'll do something, they actually follow through."
- **Anchors:** Frequency
- **Gap direction:** Most people overrate (blind spot territory)

### Q5
- **Self:** "I show up on time for things that matter to the people in my life."
- **Friend:** "[Name] is someone who shows up on time when it matters."
- **Anchors:** Frequency
- **Gap direction:** Most people overrate (blind spot territory)

### Q6
- **Self:** "I'm good at staying organized and on top of things in my daily life."
- **Friend:** "[Name] seems organized and on top of things."
- **Anchors:** Comparison
- **Gap direction:** Mixed — high performers underrate, average performers overrate

---

## Category 3: Composure & Emotional Stability

*Research basis: Neuroticism is primarily known to the self (privileged internal access). The gap between "how anxious I feel inside" and "how calm I appear to others" is large and consistent. This is the best hidden strength territory — the most emotionally moving result category.*

### Q7
- **Self:** "I stay calm and level-headed when things go wrong or get stressful."
- **Friend:** "[Name] stays calm and level-headed when things go wrong."
- **Anchors:** Frequency
- **Gap direction:** Most people underrate themselves (hidden strength territory)

### Q8
- **Self:** "My stress and worries are visible to the people around me."
- **Friend:** "[Name]'s stress and worries are visible — you can tell when something is bothering them."
- **Anchors:** Frequency
- **Gap direction:** Reverse-scored. People overrate how visible their stress is (hidden strength: you're more composed than you think)
- **Note:** This question is reverse-scored. A high self-score + low friend score = hidden strength

### Q9
- **Self:** "I handle unexpected changes or setbacks without getting thrown off."
- **Friend:** "[Name] handles unexpected changes or setbacks without getting thrown off."
- **Anchors:** Frequency
- **Gap direction:** Most people underrate themselves (hidden strength territory)

---

## Category 4: Social Energy & Presence

*Research basis: Observable traits have high agreement for existence, but the quality and impact of someone's social presence is evaluative and shows larger gaps. Introverts systematically underestimate how engaging and warm they come across. This is strong hidden strength territory for a large segment of users.*

### Q10
- **Self:** "I bring energy to a group — people feel more engaged when I'm around."
- **Friend:** "[Name] brings energy to a group — people seem more engaged when they're around."
- **Anchors:** Comparison
- **Gap direction:** Introverts underrate, extraverts slightly overrate

### Q11
- **Self:** "I make people feel comfortable and welcome, especially in new or awkward situations."
- **Friend:** "[Name] makes people feel comfortable and welcome, especially in new or awkward situations."
- **Anchors:** Comparison
- **Gap direction:** Most people underrate (hidden strength territory)

### Q12
- **Self:** "I'm the kind of person others remember meeting."
- **Friend:** "[Name] is the kind of person you remember meeting."
- **Anchors:** Comparison
- **Gap direction:** Most people underrate (hidden strength territory). High shareability when friends rate higher than self.

---

## Category 5: Self-Awareness & Openness to Feedback

*Research basis: Self-awareness is meta-evaluative (evaluating your own evaluation ability) and shows some of the most ironic gaps — people who overrate their self-awareness are, by definition, the least self-aware. Open-mindedness is also extremely overrated in self-report. This category creates the most thought-provoking results.*

### Q13
- **Self:** "I'm open to hearing things about myself that might be hard to hear."
- **Friend:** "[Name] is genuinely open to hearing things about themselves that might be hard to hear."
- **Anchors:** Comparison
- **Gap direction:** Most people overrate (blind spot territory). The irony is the insight.

### Q14
- **Self:** "When I'm wrong about something, I admit it and change my mind."
- **Friend:** "When [Name] is wrong about something, they admit it and change their mind."
- **Anchors:** Frequency
- **Gap direction:** Most people overrate (blind spot territory)

### Q15
- **Self:** "I notice how my mood or behavior affects the people around me."
- **Friend:** "[Name] seems aware of how their mood and behavior affect the people around them."
- **Anchors:** Frequency
- **Gap direction:** Mixed — highly emotionally intelligent people underrate, most people overrate

## Implementation Notes

### Reverse-Scored Questions
- **Q8** ("My stress is visible...") is reverse-scored. A high self-rating (5 = "my stress is very visible") combined with a low friend rating (2 = "they seem pretty calm") reveals a hidden strength. The scoring logic needs to invert this question before calculating the gap.

### Result Framing
Based on the research, results should be framed as:
- **Blind spots** → "Growth opportunities your friends have been too polite to tell you about"
- **Hidden strengths** → "Qualities your friends see in you that you take for granted"
- **Alignment** → "Where your self-image matches reality — you know yourself well here"

### Named Archetypes (Future)
Consider generating named result archetypes based on the combination of top blind spot + top hidden strength:
- "The Quiet Storm" — Low self-rated composure, high friend-rated composure
- "The Unsung Rock" — Low self-rated social presence, high friend-rated reliability
- "The Accidental Leader" — Low self-rated presence, high friend-rated energy and impact
- "The Heart in Progress" — High self-rated kindness, lower friend-rated kindness (growth territory)
- "The Steady Hand" — High alignment across all categories (rare, genuinely self-aware)

### Viral Shareability
The categories are deliberately designed so that:
- **Everyone gets at least one hidden strength** (Composure and Social Presence skew that way) — this ensures every user has something positive and shareable
- **Everyone gets at least one blind spot** (Patience and Reliability skew that way) — this ensures every user gets genuine insight
- The combination creates the "surprising but plausible" emotional response that drives sharing
