# Landing Page Update Recommendations

> Based on research findings from `research-self-perception-gaps.md`.
> Goal: Make the product's intent crystal clear, leverage proven psychological hooks, and optimize for conversion + virality.

## Executive Summary

The current landing page looks great visually after the redesign (gradients, glassmorphism, bold copy), but the **messaging doesn't fully leverage what the research tells us about why people take perception quizzes**. The research revealed specific psychological drivers, competitive white space, and proven hooks that should reshape how we present the product.

### Top 3 Changes Needed

1. **Lead with the gap, not the process** — The hero should immediately communicate the surprising insight (you don't know yourself as well as you think), not the mechanics
2. **Add social proof of the insight** — Show anonymized example results that demonstrate what blind spots and hidden strengths actually look like
3. **Reframe the value props around research-backed findings** — The "95% think they're self-aware, only 10% are" stat is the most powerful hook we have

## Section-by-Section Recommendations

### 1. Hero Section

**Current:** "You think you know yourself. Your friends disagree."
**Assessment:** Good provocation, but doesn't communicate what the user gets or why it matters.

**Recommended changes:**

- **Badge pill:** Change from "2 minutes. 12 traits. 0 sugarcoating." to something that establishes credibility:
  - Option A: "Based on personality psychology research"
  - Option B: "95% of people think they're self-aware. Only 10% are."
  - Option C: "Backed by the Johari Window framework"

- **Headline:** The current one is strong. Consider a slight refinement:
  - Current: "You think you know yourself. Your friends disagree."
  - Alt: "You think you know how you come across. You probably don't."
  - The current version is punchier. Keep it.

- **Subhead:** The current subhead describes the process. Replace with the *why* — what makes this worth doing:
  - Current: "Answer 12 quick questions about yourself, share a link with friends, and discover the gap between self-perception and reality."
  - Recommended: "Research shows we have massive blind spots about our own personality. The traits you're most proud of might not even register with the people around you — and your real superpower might be something you take for granted."
  - This directly ties to the SOKA model findings and creates emotional stakes.

- **CTA:** "Discover Your Blind Spots" is good. Consider A/B testing against:
  - "See How Others Really See You"
  - "Find Your Blind Spots"

- **Trust line:** Add the research-backed stat:
  - Current: "Free to start · No account required for friends · Takes 2 minutes"
  - Recommended: "Free to start · No account required for friends · Takes 2 minutes · Based on personality psychology research"

### 2. How It Works Section

**Current heading:** "Dead simple. Brutally honest."
**Assessment:** Catchy but doesn't communicate what's unique about the product.

**Recommended changes:**

- **Heading:** Consider something that emphasizes the dual-input mechanic:
  - "How it works: two perspectives, one truth"
  - "Your view vs. theirs — in three steps"
  - Or keep "Dead simple. Brutally honest." — it works for tone

- **Step copy refinements based on research:**
  - Step 1: "Rate yourself" → "Rate yourself honestly" — Emphasize that self-honesty is part of the experience. Sub-copy: "Score yourself on 12 personality dimensions. Think you're a great listener? Hilariously funny? We'll find out."
  - Step 2: "Share your link" → Keep as-is, but add: "They answer anonymously — so they can be honest too." The anonymity point is critical for trust.
  - Step 3: "Face the music" → "See what they see" — "Face the music" implies negativity. Research shows we need to signal that results include positive surprises too. Sub-copy: "Compare your self-perception with your friends' ratings. Discover blind spots you never knew about — and hidden strengths you've been undervaluing."

### 3. Value Props Section

**Current:** 4 cards (Blind Spots, Hidden Strengths, See it visually, Get your match score)
**Assessment:** The first two cards are research-validated and perfect. The last two are feature descriptions, not value propositions.

**Recommended restructuring — reframe around the research:**

**New heading:** "What you'll discover" (more benefit-oriented than "The truth is in the gap")

**Card 1: Blind Spots** (keep, enhance)
- Current: "Traits you rate highly but others don't notice as much."
- Enhanced: "Traits you rate highly that others don't see the same way. Research shows people overrate their own agreeableness, listening skills, and emotional stability more than any other traits."

**Card 2: Hidden Strengths** (keep, enhance)
- Current: "Qualities others see in you that you underestimate."
- Enhanced: "Your friends see qualities in you that you take for granted. These hidden strengths are often your actual superpowers — the things that make people want you around."

**Card 3: The Gap That Matters** (new — replace "See it visually")
- "The average person's self-knowledge correlates only .20-.36 with how others see them. That means up to 70% of how you come across is invisible to you. This quiz makes it visible."
- This leverages the self-other agreement research directly.

**Card 4: Aha Moments** (new — replace "Get your match score")
- "The biggest surprises come from traits you'd never question — like how funny you are, how well you actually listen, or whether your confidence reads as warmth or as distance."
- This previews the specific types of insights and creates curiosity.

### 4. NEW: Social Proof / Example Results Section

**This section doesn't exist yet and should be added.**

The research is clear: showing anonymized example results dramatically increases conversion because it demonstrates the "aha moment" before the user commits.

**Recommended design:**

Add a section between Value Props and Stat Bar with heading:
- "What real blind spots look like"

Show 2-3 anonymized example insight cards:

> **Example 1:** "Sarah rated herself 2/5 on humor. Her friends averaged 4.2/5. Her hidden strength? She's way funnier than she thinks."

> **Example 2:** "Marcus rated himself 5/5 on listening. His friends averaged 3.1/5. His blind spot? He talks more than he realizes."

> **Example 3:** "Jordan rated herself 2/5 on leadership. Her friends averaged 4.5/5. People follow her more than she knows."

These examples:
- Demonstrate the product mechanic instantly
- Create emotional resonance ("I wonder if that's me")
- Show that results include both positive surprises and growth areas
- Make the abstract concept concrete

### 5. Stat Bar

**Current:** "12 personality traits / 100% anonymous / 2 min"
**Assessment:** These are features, not emotional hooks.

**Recommended changes — replace with research-backed stats:**

| Current | Recommended |
|---|---|
| "12 personality traits" | "12 traits where self-knowledge breaks down" |
| "100% anonymous" | "100% anonymous — so they can be honest" |
| "2 min" | "2 min to discover what you can't see" |

Or go bolder with the research stats:
- "85% of people think they're above average at social skills"
- "Friends agree with each other more than they agree with you"
- "Only 10% of people are as self-aware as they think"

### 6. Pricing Section

**Current:** Free vs. Paid comparison with feature lists
**Assessment:** Solid structure. Two refinements needed:

**Refinement 1: Clarify what the free tier actually shows**
- The free result should feel genuinely valuable (this is the 16Personalities lesson)
- Make clear: "Free gives you the overall picture. Paid gives you the trait-by-trait truth."

**Refinement 2: Reframe paid tier around research insights**
- Current paid tagline: "Less than two lattes. Lasts longer than therapy."
- This is funny but doesn't communicate what you get. Add specificity:
- "See exactly which traits you overestimate, which ones you undervalue, and what your friends would never tell you to your face."

**Pricing validation:** Research shows $7.99 one-time is well-positioned. Competitors charge $19-60 for personality reports. Our price is low enough to be impulsive but high enough to signal value.

### 7. Final CTA Banner

**Current:** "Ready to find out what they really think?"
**Assessment:** Good. Could be stronger by calling back to the research hook.

**Alternatives:**
- "You're probably in the 90% who think they're self-aware but aren't. Find out."
- "Your friends already know your blind spots. Now you can too."
- "Ready to see yourself through their eyes?"

### 8. Footer

**No changes needed.** The current footer is clean and functional.

## New Sections to Add

### A. "The Science" Section (between How It Works and Value Props)

A brief section that establishes research credibility without being clinical:

**Heading:** "This isn't a BuzzFeed quiz"

**Copy:**
"PerceptionQuiz is built on decades of personality psychology research. The Johari Window framework (1955) maps the gap between what you know about yourself and what others see. Simine Vazire's Self-Other Knowledge Asymmetry research (2010) proved that for many traits — especially warmth, creativity, and emotional stability — your friends literally know you better than you know yourself.

We turned that science into something you can actually use."

**Why:** This differentiates from entertainment quizzes, builds credibility, and explains why the friend-rating mechanic matters. It addresses the inevitable "is this real?" objection.

### B. Social Proof / Example Results (detailed above in section 4)

### C. FAQ Section (before Footer)

Common objections that the research suggests users will have:

- **"Will my friends actually be honest?"** — "Responses are 100% anonymous. Your friends see a simple rating scale — no names attached to scores. Research shows anonymous peer ratings are significantly more honest than face-to-face feedback."
- **"What if I don't like what I see?"** — "Most people are surprised by how many hidden strengths their friends see in them. Blind spots go both ways — you're probably underestimating yourself on traits that matter."
- **"Is this scientifically valid?"** — "Our trait dimensions are based on the Big Five personality model and the Johari Window framework, both widely used in psychology research. The self-other comparison methodology is based on Vazire's SOKA model."
- **"How many friends do I need?"** — "You'll see your results after 3 friends respond, but the more responses you get, the more accurate the picture. Most users invite 5-10 people."

## Copy Tone Guidelines

Based on the research on what makes quiz products shareable and what messaging drives signups:

### Do:
- Be slightly provocative — "You probably don't know yourself as well as you think"
- Use specific numbers and research stats — they build credibility and curiosity
- Frame results as gifts, not judgments — "discover" not "get scored"
- Acknowledge that results include positive surprises — reduce fear of negativity
- Use "your friends" not "others" — personalizes the experience

### Don't:
- Sound clinical — "assess your personality dimensions" kills the vibe
- Sound like self-help — "become your best self" is generic and off-putting
- Promise only negative revelations — "find out what's wrong with you" creates resistance
- Be vague — "learn about yourself" says nothing. Be specific about what they'll learn

### Voice:
- Curious, not judgmental
- Playful, not silly
- Confident, not clinical
- Slightly provocative, not aggressive
- Smart, not academic

## Metrics to Watch After Implementation

- **Hero → CTA click rate** — Does the new messaging drive more quiz starts?
- **Peer invitation rate** — Do users invite more friends with better framing?
- **Peer completion rate** — Do friends finish the rating quiz? (Target: >70%)
- **Result share rate** — Do users share results on social? (Benchmark: Spotify Wrapped)
- **Conversion to paid** — Does the research framing increase willingness to pay?
- **K-factor** — Does the viral loop produce >1 new user per existing user?
