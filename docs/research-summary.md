# PerceptionQuiz — Research Summary

## Overview

This document summarizes research into self-perception vs. others' perception psychology, competitive landscape, question design best practices, and viral marketing strategy. The goal: identify what types of questions create the most surprising, emotionally resonant, and shareable gaps between how users see themselves and how their friends see them.

## 1. Key Academic Frameworks

### The Johari Window (Luft & Ingham, 1955)

The Johari Window maps self-knowledge across two dimensions — what is known to self vs. what is known to others — creating four quadrants:

- **Open Area** — Known to self AND others (e.g., talkativeness, warmth)
- **Blind Spot** — Unknown to self but known to others (e.g., arrogance, hidden creativity)
- **Hidden Area** — Known to self but hidden from others (e.g., inner anxiety, insecurities)
- **Unknown** — Not known to anyone

**Relevance:** PerceptionQuiz is essentially a scored, quantified, emotionally compelling Johari Window for a consumer audience. The Johari framework gives academic credibility; our experience gives it entertainment value that academic tools lack. Digital Johari tools exist (johari-window.com) but remain niche, clunky, and corporate-focused. No product has successfully brought this framework to a casual/social audience.

### The SOKA Model — Vazire (2010)

The **Self-Other Knowledge Asymmetry (SOKA)** model is the single most directly relevant academic framework for our product. Published in the Journal of Personality and Social Psychology by Simine Vazire (UC Davis), the SOKA model predicts exactly where self-knowledge fails using a 2x2 matrix:

|                    | Non-Evaluative              | Evaluative                        |
|--------------------|-----------------------------|------------------------------------|
| **Observable**     | Equal accuracy              | **Others more accurate**           |
| **Internal**       | **Self more accurate**      | Others more accurate               |

**The critical insight:** The most interesting blind spots are in **evaluative traits** — traits we care about, that carry social desirability weight, and where motivated self-perception distorts our view. These include kindness, reliability, emotional intelligence, creativity, leadership, and warmth.

**The hidden strengths insight:** Internal, non-evaluative traits like anxiety/neuroticism are known better by the self. People who rate themselves as highly anxious may actually be overestimating how much others see it. "You feel far more anxious than you appear" is the kind of genuinely moving result this creates.

### Big Five / OCEAN — Self-Other Agreement by Trait

A meta-analysis across 36 studies measured how well self-ratings agree with ratings from people who know the person well:

| Trait               | Agreement (r) | Notes                                      |
|---------------------|---------------|---------------------------------------------|
| Extraversion        | .62           | Highest — most observable                   |
| Openness            | .59           | Fairly high                                 |
| Conscientiousness   | .56           | Moderate                                    |
| Neuroticism         | .51           | Lower — internal state                      |
| Agreeableness       | .46           | **Lowest — biggest blind spot territory**   |

**The takeaway:** Lower correlation = bigger potential gap = more interesting quiz results. **Agreeableness and Neuroticism are our richest territory.**

### Dunning-Kruger Effect & Illusory Superiority

Research on where people most consistently overrate themselves:

- **Getting along with others:** 85% rate themselves above median; 25% claim top 1%
- **Leadership:** 70% of students rate themselves above median
- **Moral qualities:** People consistently rate themselves as more just, trustworthy, and honest than they are (the "moral superiority bias")
- **Emotional intelligence:** Ironically one of the most overrated traits
- **Work ethic / reliability:** Systematically overrated
- **Driving ability:** 88-93% put themselves in the top 50%
- **Intelligence:** 60-70% believe they are above average (men overestimate by ~5 IQ points; women underestimate by a similar margin)

### Traits People Systematically Underrate (Hidden Strengths)

- **Emotional stability / composure** — People experiencing significant inner anxiety routinely underestimate how composed they appear. The gap between "how anxious I feel" and "how anxious I seem" is large
- **Extraversion in introverts** — Introverts often underestimate how engaging, interesting, and warm they come across socially
- **Conscientiousness in high performers** — High-ability people assume their reliability is ordinary; others rate them much higher
- **Humor** — Genuinely funny people consistently underestimate how amusing they are
- **Physical attractiveness** — People rate their own attractiveness lower than strangers do

A 2022 PMC study found that underestimation of Extraversion, Conscientiousness, and Emotional Stability is associated with higher well-being and self-insight — meaning accurate self-humility predicts flourishing. This is a powerful framing for result delivery.

## 2. Competitive Landscape

### Direct Competitors

| Product | What It Does | Gap / Weakness |
|---------|-------------|----------------|
| Johari Window apps | Adjective matching grid, self vs. others | Clunky, academic, not fun, no scoring |
| "How Well Do You Know Me?" apps | Trivia about the user (facts, not traits) | Tests knowledge of facts, not perception |
| Crystal Knows | AI-powered DISC profiling from public data | B2B/sales focus, not social/personal |
| VIA Character Strengths | 24-strength survey, $15+ premium | Self-only, no comparison, clinical feel |
| 16Personalities | Free MBTI-type test, $32.99 premium | Self-only, no comparison, massive audience |
| Truity | Big Five, Enneagram, TypeFinder | Freemium, self-only |
| BetterUp / Ahead App | Professional coaching self-awareness | Enterprise, not social |

**The gap:** No existing consumer product does structured, scored, shareable self-vs-friend comparison with emotional framing. This is a genuine whitespace.

### Pricing Benchmarks

| Product | Free Tier | Paid |
|---------|-----------|------|
| 16Personalities | Free test | $32.99 premium profile |
| VIA Character Strengths | Free survey | $15-20 reports |
| Truity | Free basic | $19-29 premium reports |
| Enneagram Institute (RHETI) | None | $20/person |

**Our $7.99 one-time price is well below market** and positions as an impulse buy rather than a considered purchase.

### Market Size

The global personality assessment market was valued at $10.3 billion in 2024, growing at 12.5% CAGR through 2034. Cloud/SaaS-based tools hold 67% of market share. The consumer/social segment is significantly underpenetrated.

## 3. Most Compelling Question Categories

Ranked by potential to create surprising, emotionally resonant gaps:

### Tier 1 — Highest Gap Potential

**1. Kindness & Patience Under Pressure**
- Research basis: Agreeableness has the lowest self-other agreement of all Big Five traits (r=.46). People dramatically overrate how patient, kind, and empathetic they are under stress
- Friends see you snap at the waiter, get passive-aggressive in traffic, give advice when the other person wanted to vent
- Emotional hook: Humbling but not devastating. Produces genuine reflection

**2. Reliability & Follow-Through**
- Research basis: Conscientiousness shows significant overestimation bias. People remember their successes and forget their dropped balls
- Friends track all the "I'll text you back" and "let's plan that trip" that never materialized
- Emotional hook: Painfully relatable. Almost universal blind spot

**3. Composure (Anxiety vs. Appearance)**
- Research basis: Neuroticism is primarily known to the self but systematically hidden from others. The inner experience vs. outer appearance gap is large
- Hidden strength territory: "You feel far more anxious than you appear"
- Emotional hook: Genuinely moving. Highly shareable

**4. Emotional Intelligence & Listening**
- Research basis: EQ is one of the most overrated traits in self-assessment. Empathy and active listening are especially subject to illusory superiority
- Do you actually remember what they told you last month? Do you listen or wait to talk?
- Emotional hook: Creates productive discomfort. Actionable for growth

### Tier 2 — Strong Gap Potential

**5. Humor**
- Genuinely funny people systematically underrate themselves; unfunny people overrate. Delightful hidden strength territory

**6. Confidence vs. Arrogance**
- People cannot accurately assess the line between healthy confidence and coming across as domineering. The most defensiveness-producing but also most valuable result

**7. Social Presence / First Impression**
- Observable quality, but the *quality* of the impression is evaluative with larger gaps. Pure hidden strength territory for introverts

**8. Supportiveness as a Friend**
- "Are you the friend who shows up, or the friend who means to?" Social role performance is evaluative and observable — others outperform self-assessment here

### Tier 3 — Useful But Lower Gap

- Creativity, Adventurousness, Communication clarity, Open-mindedness

### Category to Avoid

**Raw intelligence.** Produces the most defensiveness and the least actionable insight. Not emotionally safe enough for a fun, shareable product.

## 4. Question Design Best Practices

### Wording Strategy: Behavioral + Impression Hybrid

- **Self version → behavioral/situational:** "How often do you cancel plans within 24 hours?" — harder to lie to yourself about
- **Friend version → impression-based:** "How reliable is [Name] compared to most people you know?" — easier for friends to rate based on overall impression

This asymmetry is a feature, not a bug. The different vantage points produce more interesting gap analysis.

### Scale Design

**5-point Likert with labeled anchors is optimal.** Recommended anchors:

- Avoid: "Never / Rarely / Sometimes / Often / Always" — triggers midpoint bias
- Better: "Much less than most people / Somewhat less / About the same / Somewhat more / Much more than most people" — normalizes all positions
- Or for frequency: "Almost never / A few times a year / Once or twice a month / About weekly / Almost daily"

### Reducing Social Desirability Bias

1. **Specificity over character:** "How often do you cancel plans within 24 hours?" beats "How reliable are you?"
2. **Third-person preamble for self:** "Your friends would say I..." shifts frame from self-report to imagined observer
3. **Avoid leading positive framing:** "I am a good listener" invites agreement bias
4. **Make the low end socially acceptable:** "I'm more of a problem-solver than a comforter" is better than "I'm not very empathetic"
5. **Balance item valence:** Mix positively and negatively framed items
6. **Keep preamble brief:** Preambles over 25 words reduce honest responding

### Question Count

- **12 questions:** Optimal completion rate, feels substantial
- **15 questions:** Strong if 3 per category (5 categories)
- **20 questions:** Retention drops; each additional question reduces completion by ~8-12%

For the friend version especially, keep at 12-15.

## 5. Branding & Marketing Strategy

### Recommended Primary Positioning

**"Your friends know something about you that you don't"**

This hook creates curiosity, mild FOMO, and social invitation simultaneously. It's the strongest differentiator from every other personality test (which are self-only).

Other strong options:
- "Find out what your friends actually see in you"
- "The gap between who you think you are and who you actually are"
- "The quiz your friends take about you" — immediately differentiates

### Emotional Hooks That Drive Sharing

1. **Surprise with validation** — The most powerful trigger. Result reveals something suspected but never named. "I knew it" energy, elevated
2. **Flattery via hidden strengths** — "You appear far more composed under pressure than you feel" is deeply shareable because it makes you look good AND reveals something meaningful
3. **Productive vulnerability** — Frame blind spots as gifts, not indictments: "Here's a growth opportunity your friends have been too polite to tell you about"
4. **Relational invitation** — "Your friend rated you 4.5 on composure. Did that surprise you?" creates a two-way conversation loop

### What Makes People Share Quiz Results

- 66% of personality quiz shares are to signal identity ("This is who I am")
- People share when results feel specific (not generic) and positive enough to be seen publicly
- MBTI and Enneagram succeed because they give users a portable identity label
- **Our results should produce named archetypes** — "The Quiet Storm" (high hidden strength on composure), "The Accidental Leader" (blind spot on underselling leadership). Named archetypes become identity, and identity gets shared

### Viral Loop Design

1. "Now find out what your friends really see" should appear immediately after self-assessment — before results. Create anticipation
2. Give friends something too — "You're more generous than 80% of other raters"
3. Progressive reveal of results — show gaps category by category with micro-reactions
4. Group comparison — "Your friends see Composure as your #1 hidden strength. Only 12% of people get this"
5. Make the share card irresistible — gap visualization, named archetype, one compelling sentence
