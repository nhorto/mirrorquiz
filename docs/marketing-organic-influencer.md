# PerceptionQuiz — Organic & Influencer Marketing Playbook

**Date:** February 2026
**Budget:** $100-500/month to start
**Starting point:** Zero audience, personal accounts with <100 followers
**Experience level:** No prior marketing experience

---

## 1. TikTok Organic Strategy

### Why TikTok First

TikTok distributes content based on what the video does, not who posted it. A brand-new account with zero followers can get 50,000 views on its third video. This makes TikTok the highest-priority channel for a zero-audience launch.

The algorithm measures:
- Engagement velocity (how fast people engage in the first 30 minutes)
- Watch-through rate
- Shares via DM

### Content Formats That Work

**1. Reaction/Reveal Format** (Highest converting)
Show someone seeing their PerceptionQuiz results for the first time. Real, unscripted reaction. The gap between what they expected and what friends said IS the content.

**2. POV Videos**
"POV: Your friends just submitted their ratings of you and you're about to see them." Text overlay on a neutral face. No budget required.

**3. Educational Hooks With a Twist**
Explain a psychological concept (blind spots, Dunning-Kruger, Johari Window) but frame it as something uncomfortable in a good way. #selfimprovement has 8.3 billion views.

**4. Trending Audio Overlays**
Use trending sounds and layer your concept on top. "Tell me you have a blind spot about [trait] without telling me you have a blind spot."

**5. Duets and Stitches**
Stitch psychology/relationship creators and add the PerceptionQuiz angle.

### Posting Frequency

- **Weeks 1-2:** 1-2 times per day (account warm-up phase)
- **Weeks 3+:** 1 video per day minimum, never below 5 per week
- Consistency matters more than perfection
- Do NOT delete poorly performing videos — TikTok sometimes surfaces old content weeks later

### Realistic Timeline: 0 to 1,000 Followers

| Timeline | Expected Followers |
|----------|-------------------|
| Month 1 | 100-500 |
| Month 2 | 500-2,000 |
| Average to hit 1K | ~20 videos (3-4 weeks at daily posting) |

One "medium viral" video (50K-200K views) can compress this to under 2 weeks.

### Hashtag Strategy

Use 3-5 per video, not 20+. Rotate through:

- **Broad:** #selfimprovement #personaldevelopment #psychology #selfawareness
- **Niche:** #blindspots #personalitytypes #knowyourself #selfdiscovery
- **Trend hooks:** #POV #relatable #themoreyouknow
- **Product:** #personalityquiz #howotherseeyou

## 2. Your First 20 TikTok Posts

Post these in approximately this order. They build from low-effort to more refined:

1. **Founder intro** — "I built an app to find out if you know yourself as well as you think. Here's why."
2. **Concept in 30 seconds** — "You rate yourself. Your friends rate you. You see the gap. That's it."
3. **First reaction video** — someone takes the quiz on camera and sees results
4. **Educational** — "The trait people most commonly overrate in themselves" (no product pitch)
5. **POV** — "You think your friends love how direct you are. They submitted their answers. You open the app..."
6. **Stitch** — Stitch a psychology/relationship video with your blind spot angle
7. **Value content** — "3 things your friends notice about you that you're completely unaware of"
8. **Second reaction video** — different person, different result gap
9. **Educational** — "The Johari Window explained in 30 seconds" — end with quiz CTA
10. **Comment reply** — respond to a comment on video 3 or 4
11. **Educational** — "What the Dunning-Kruger Effect means for your relationships"
12. **Data content** — "Most common trait people underrate in themselves (based on our data so far)"
13. **POV** — "Your best friend just finished rating you and their face when they hit submit"
14. **Problem/solution** — "How to actually find out if you're as good a listener as you think"
15. **Third reaction video** — someone whose results surprised them significantly
16. **Trend adaptation** — take a trending sound and overlay your concept
17. **Use case expansion** — "What happens when couples take this quiz about each other"
18. **Friend group challenge** — show 3 friends comparing their gap scores
19. **Behind-the-scenes** — "Here's what the questions actually look like"
20. **Social proof milestone** — "100 people have taken this. Here's the most common blind spot."

## 3. Instagram Strategy

### Format Priority

| Format | Purpose | Frequency |
|--------|---------|-----------|
| Reels | Growth — reaches non-followers through Explore | 4-5/week |
| Carousels | Saves and authority — highest engagement from followers | 2-3/week |
| Stories | Conversion and relationship — polls, CTAs, testimonials | Daily, 3-5 frames |

**Reels are your primary growth engine.** The signals that matter: watch time, likes per viewer, and DM sends.

**Carousels** get the most saves. "5 blind spots most people have about themselves" gets bookmarked and re-shared repeatedly.

**Stories** convert followers to buyers. Use for: behind-the-scenes, polls, countdowns, testimonials.

### Content Pillar Framework (Weekly Mix)

| Pillar | % of Content | What It Is |
|--------|-------------|------------|
| Entertainment | 40% | Reactions, reveals, relatable situations about being misread |
| Education | 25% | Psychology concepts made digestible (blind spots, Johari Window) |
| Community/UGC | 20% | Share results screenshots, ask questions, tag people |
| Product | 10% | App demos, feature walkthroughs, question format |
| Founder Story | 5% | Why you built this, your own results, the human behind it |

### Using Instagram Native Features as Product Demos

Story sequences that simulate the PerceptionQuiz experience:

1. Post a Story poll: "Do your friends think you're a good listener?" (Yes/No)
2. Follow up: "Now go ask three of them."
3. Day 2: "The app that shows you the actual gap — link in bio."

Run polls like: "Which trait do you think you're overestimating most?" Then share the aggregate result in the next Story.

### Cross-Posting TikTok to Instagram

You can cross-post TikTok content as Reels, but **remove the TikTok watermark** first (use SnapTik or similar). Instagram deprioritizes watermarked TikTok content.

### Time Commitment

- Launch phase: ~1.5 hours/day
- Steady state: ~45 minutes/day once systems are in place

## 4. Content Ideas (20 Specific Ideas)

### Hook-Driven Short Videos (TikTok/Reels)

1. "The trait you overrate the most about yourself — according to 500 people who took this quiz"
2. "POV: Your friends just rated your confidence. You rated yourself a 10. They gave you a 6."
3. "I thought I was the funny one in my friend group. I took PerceptionQuiz. I was wrong."
4. "3 ways you're probably worse at [trait] than you think" + CTA to take the quiz
5. "What happens when roommates take this quiz about each other"
6. "The one blind spot almost every person has — and why it's so hard to see"
7. "Couples are using this to stop arguments before they start"
8. "Your friends see something you don't. They've always seen it. Now you can too."
9. "Rate yourself as a communicator before you watch this. I'll wait."
10. "The gap between how you see yourself and how others see you — visualized" (show bar charts)

### Educational/Value Content

11. "The Johari Window explained in 45 seconds" (end: "PerceptionQuiz is a digital Johari Window")
12. "Why smart people are often the worst at knowing their blind spots"
13. "5 traits that humans are statistically bad at self-assessing"
14. "Your self-perception forms by age 7. Here's why that's a problem."
15. "The science of why compliments feel less real than criticism"

### Shareability/Tag-a-Friend

16. "Tag someone who thinks they're a 10/10 empath"
17. "Send this to your most self-aware friend and your least self-aware friend"
18. "Which of your friends has the biggest blind spot? Comment their name."
19. "Challenge: Ask 3 friends to rate you on [trait] before you take the quiz."
20. "Friend group gap challenge — who has the biggest difference between self-rating and friend ratings?"

### Hook Formats That Perform Best

| Hook Type | Example | Why It Works |
|-----------|---------|-------------|
| Contradiction | "You're probably worse at [trait] than you think." | Challenges self-image, triggers defensive curiosity |
| POV | "POV: You rated yourself 9/10. Your friends submitted their answers last night." | Narrative tension |
| Data | "We analyzed 1,000 responses. The most overrated trait?" | Authority + curiosity |
| Challenge | "Rate yourself on EQ right now. Remember that number. Now watch." | Delayed payoff |
| Identification | "If you think you're a good listener, this is for you." | Specific audience call-out |
| Social proof | "My friend cried when she saw her results. This is why." | Emotional intrigue |

### Making Educational Content Entertaining

**The rule:** Lead with feeling, follow with fact, end with action.

**Bad:** "The Dunning-Kruger Effect suggests that people with limited knowledge overestimate their competence."

**Good:** "There's a reason the people who are the worst at [skill] also think they're the best at it. It's not arrogance. It's a cognitive trap we all fall into. And it's invisible from the inside."

Framework:
1. Open with a relatable, slightly uncomfortable truth (6 seconds)
2. Name the phenomenon casually, not academically (10 seconds)
3. One concrete, specific example (10 seconds)
4. Land on the emotional implication (5 seconds)
5. Optional CTA

## 5. Influencer Strategy

### Who to Target

| Tier | Followers | Cost | Engagement | When to Use |
|------|-----------|------|------------|-------------|
| **Nano** | 1K-10K | $0-150/post | 5-10% | Start here (Month 1) |
| **Micro** | 10K-50K | $150-500/video | 3-6% | Phase 2 (Month 2-3) |
| Macro (100K+) | — | — | — | Not until budget >$1K/month |

### Niches to Target

Search for creators who post in these categories:
- Psychology explainers ("did you know" style)
- Self-improvement / journaling / personal growth
- Relationship advice and communication
- MBTI / Enneagram / personality type content
- "Storytime" vulnerable personal stories
- Therapy-adjacent wellness

A personality type creator with 8K followers whose audience actively discusses MBTI results is more valuable than a general lifestyle creator with 50K followers.

### How to Find Influencers

**Free methods:**
- **TikTok:** Search #personalitytype, #MBTI, #selfawareness, #blindspots. Find videos with 5K-200K views. Check creator profile — if average video gets 10-50% of followers in views, they have good engagement.
- **Instagram:** Same hashtag search. Look for accounts with engagement rate above 3%.
- **TikTok Creator Marketplace:** Free, search by niche and follower range.

**Paid tools (when budget allows):**
- **Collabstr.com:** Lists verified influencers with upfront pricing. No subscription. Filter by platform, niche, follower range, price. TikTok creators in lifestyle/wellness for $50-300/video.
- **Upfluence:** More enterprise but has a free tier for searching.

### Outreach Template

DM (better for nano) or email (better for those with media kits):

> Hi [Name] — I love your content on [specific topic they cover]. I built a quiz app called PerceptionQuiz that shows you the gap between how you see yourself and how your friends actually see you — it's kind of wild to look at. I'd love to send you a free link to try it. No strings attached. If you like it and want to collaborate, I'll throw in a 30% affiliate commission for anyone who purchases through your link. Either way, curious what you'd think. [Your name]

**Follow-up:** One follow-up after 5 days. Then move on. Never more than twice.

### Compensation Structure (Priority Order)

1. **Free access + 30% affiliate commission** — Best for nano. At $7.99 and 30%, they earn $2.40/conversion. An influencer with 5K engaged followers converting 0.5% earns $60 from one post.
2. **Free access + flat fee ($25-100) + affiliate** — For micro-influencers who want a guarantee.
3. **Flat fee only ($100-300)** — Only for influencers with documented engagement. Request analytics screenshot before agreeing.

### Influencer Brief (What to Send After They Agree)

One page maximum:
- What PerceptionQuiz is (2 sentences)
- Core angle: you see yourself one way; friends see you another; PerceptionQuiz shows the gap
- What you're asking: one TikTok or Reel, 30-60 seconds, honest review
- What to include: their honest reaction, app name, affiliate link
- What NOT to do: don't read from a script, don't use our marketing language, be yourself
- Their affiliate link and tracking code
- Deadline

**The best influencer content sounds nothing like an ad.** Give creative freedom.

### Expected Conversion Rates

| Metric | Benchmark |
|--------|-----------|
| Link click rate | 1-3% of viewers |
| Click → purchase | 3-8% |
| Per 10K video views | 3-24 purchases |

At $7.99 with 30% affiliate, you need 13+ purchases per post to break even on a $25 flat fee. Treat early posts as learning investment.

## 6. Viral Loop Design

### The Psychology of Why People Share Quiz Results

People share quiz results because results serve as a social signal — they communicate identity, invite comparison, and create conversation. When a personality description resonates, it activates the medial prefrontal cortex (self-relevance and reward). People share things that make them feel seen.

### Three Built-In Viral Loops

**Loop 1 — The Invitation Loop**
To get results, users must invite friends to submit ratings. Each invitation contains "I want to know how you see me" + PerceptionQuiz branding. Recipients click, rate their friend, see the brand. Conversion from recipient to new user is higher than any ad.

**Loop 2 — The Results Share Loop**
After results, prompt sharing. The share card shows their gap score (not actual ratings — keep those private). Example: "My friends rated me 7.2/10 on confidence. I rated myself 9.1. I found out why." Shareable because it's vulnerable, intriguing, and incomplete.

**Loop 3 — The Challenge Loop**
"I just did PerceptionQuiz. My gap score: 1.4. What's yours?" Post to Stories. Creates social comparison — people don't want to be left out of trends their friends are doing.

### The Perception Gap Challenge

Structure:
- User posts their gap score to Stories or TikTok
- Tags two friends and challenges them to find theirs
- Tags @PerceptionQuiz

This is the exact format that drove Ice Bucket Challenge, Wordle sharing, and personality type sharing. The gap score is a number, which makes it competitive and comparable.

### User-Generated Content Strategy

- **Results Template:** Create a Canva template users can fill with their gap scores and share (branded)
- **Repost Strategy:** Re-share everything users tag you in to your Stories (incentivizes more tagging)
- **Monthly Prompt:** "Share your biggest surprise in the comments. Best one gets shared to our followers."
- **TikTok Stitch Invitation:** "Stitch this video with your PerceptionQuiz results."

### Discord/Community?

**No. Not yet.** Discord requires active moderation and with no audience, you'll maintain an empty room. Revisit at 5,000 users.

For now, the "community" lives in your TikTok/Instagram comments. **Respond to every single comment for the first 60 days.** Every reply increases engagement score.

## 7. Launch Strategy — First 30 Days

### Pre-Launch (4 Weeks Before Launch Day)

**Week 1-2: Infrastructure + Content Bank**
- Set up TikTok and Instagram brand accounts
- Set up landing page with email capture (Carrd, Notion, or use the app's landing page)
- Film and edit 20 TikTok/Reel videos (content bank — don't post yet)
- Create waitlist: "First 100 people get 50% off at launch"
- Set up affiliate link system

**Week 3: Teaser Content Begins**
- Start posting 1-2 TikToks/day from content bank
- Build intrigue without revealing full product: "I've been working on something that shows you a blind spot you don't know you have. Launching in 2 weeks."
- No product screenshots yet. Curiosity only.
- Start reaching out to 20-30 nano-influencers

**Week 4: Escalation**
- Post daily to TikTok + Reels
- Release 30-second app preview/teaser
- Run polls: "Would you actually want to know how your friends rate you? Yes / No (I'm scared)"
- First waitlist email: "You're on the list. Launch in X days. Here's a sneak peek."
- Set up affiliate partners with early access links

### Launch Day

- Post your best TikTok at 6-9 AM in target timezone
- Post launch Reel simultaneously
- Send waitlist email: launch is live, 50% discount, expires in 48 hours
- Coordinate all influencer partners to post on launch day
- Go Live on TikTok or Instagram for 30-60 minutes — take quiz live, answer questions
- Respond to every single comment and DM personally

**Launch day post:** Your most compelling reaction video. Not a product explainer. A real person seeing their results, reacting genuinely.

### Days 2-7: Momentum Week

- Post daily
- "Day 1 results" update: "100 people took PerceptionQuiz in 24 hours. Most common blind spot? Here's what we found."
- Reply to every comment personally
- DM everyone who commented substantively: "Hey, did you end up trying it?"
- Share early user reactions to Stories (with permission)
- Cross-post best content to both platforms

### Days 8-14: Double Down

- Find highest-performing TikTok from launch week. Make 3 more in same format.
- "Week 1 wrap" video: social proof, surprising data, your own gap score
- Activate 2-3 more influencer posts
- First Instagram carousel: "5 blind spots that surprised us in our first 1,000 quizzes"

### Days 15-21: Sustain and Experiment

- Introduce a new content format (duet, stitch, longer-form)
- Story poll series: "Would you rather know the truth about [trait A] or [trait B]?"
- Launch "Perception Gap Challenge" formally with dedicated hashtag (#PerceptionGap or #MyGapScore)
- Second email to list: what you've learned from user data, what's coming, testimonial

### Days 22-30: Data-Driven Pivot

- Review TikTok analytics: highest watch-through rate videos → make more of those
- Review Instagram: highest saves posts → more carousels like that
- Identify best-performing influencer post
- Double down on what worked. Stop what didn't.
- Plan Month 2 content calendar from Month 1 data.

### Week-by-Week Summary

| Week | Focus | Daily Actions |
|------|-------|---------------|
| -4 to -2 | Build content bank, waitlist, influencer outreach | Film 2-3 videos/day, send 5-10 influencer DMs |

## 9. Metrics to Track Weekly

Track these in a simple spreadsheet:

| Platform | Metrics |
|----------|---------|
| TikTok | Video views, watch-through rate, follower count, profile visits, link clicks |
| Instagram | Reel plays, saves, shares, Story replies, link-in-bio clicks |
